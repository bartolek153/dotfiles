* Compiler
* Language specific options (ex. shiftwidth)
* Tree-sitter Parser
* Snippets
* Language Server Protocol (LSP) 
  - Check if LSP has built-in: 
    1 - Formatter
    2 - Linter (diagnostics)
  - else:
    null-ls

Things that should be working toghether:
+ Completion + Snippets;
+ Auto-formatting on save;
+ Linting;
+ Syntax highlighting;
+ Code Actions (maybe).
